**Executive Summary**

The HyperMedia-Driven Architecture (HDA) architecture is a synthesis of two preceding architectures: the original Multi-Page Application (MPA) architecture and the (relatively) newer Single-Page Application architecture.

It attempts to capture the advantages of both: the simplicity and reliability of MPAs, with a [REST-ful Architecture](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/REST) that uses [Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State](https://htmx.org/essays/hateoas/), while providing a better user experience, on par with SPAs in many cases.
