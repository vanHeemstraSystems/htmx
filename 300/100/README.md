# 100 - Motivation

- Why should only ```<a>``` & ```<form>``` be able to make HTTP requests?
- Why should only ```click``` & ```submit``` events trigger them?
- Why should only ```GET``` & ```POST``` methods be available?
- Why should you only be able to replace the **entire** screen?

By removing these constraints, htmx completes HTML as a hypertext
